title: GW Chat Utility
---

This is a tool I made for the online game Guild Wars after my first semester at RIT. Essentially, it allows you send and receive in-game messages without typing directly in the game client. Its features include a timestamp option, Guild Wars style chat channel switching (using Shift + 1-5), and notifications for new messages from each chat channel. The program is written in AutoIt, and is based around the [GWA2](http://wiki.gamerevision.com/index.php/GWA2) framework, which is an API providing functions for many in-game tasks.
