title: Rustle and Bromley Name Generator
---

[This](/generator) was something fun I put together for my friends in a local band. The script uses two word banks to generate a different take on the bandâ€™s name, with a 5% chance of something totally unrelated popping up instead. I modified a script by [Niels Gamborg](http://online-generator.com/) to generate the names and display them.
