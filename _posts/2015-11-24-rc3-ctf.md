title: RC3 CTF
---

I competed in the 2nd annual RIT Competitive Cybersecurity Club (RC3) CTF over the weekend. This was a CTF designed to appeal to both beginners and experts, with a wide variety of challenges to choose from. Categories included web, crypto, forensics, reversing, trivia, and an interesting ‘misc’ section containing challenges too unique for the other containers. The competition went from Friday at 7pm to Sunday at 8pm, with 60 registered teams participating.

Our team had a rather slow start, and picked off most of the low-hanging fruit during the first night of the competition. Saturday was spent working on a mix of mid and high-level challenges, which landed us in 7th place at the end of the day. After a few hours of work on Sunday, we had completed many of the mid-level challenges and began to focus on the more difficult challenges with high rewards. At around 4pm, our work began to pay off as we started finding flags and shot into 5th place. In the last 15 minutes of the competition, we decided to focus on a crypto challenge that would jump us to 3rd if we were successful. Everyone started applying different techniques to the challenge, until at 7:56 – 4 minutes until submissions closed – a teammate posted the flag to our Slack chat, and we leaped into 3rd place to finish the competition.

Needless to say, I had an awesome time solving challenges, and picked up quite a few web, forensics, and reversing techniques along the way. Very proud of our team for our diligent work and the big finish!
