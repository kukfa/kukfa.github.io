Simple definition from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximate_and_ultimate_causation):

> A proximate cause is an event which is closest to, or immediately responsible for causing, some observed result. This exists in contrast to a higher-level ultimate cause (or distal cause) which is usually thought of as the "real" reason something occurred. In most situations, an ultimate cause may itself be a proximate cause for a further ultimate cause.

Example from _[Guns, Germs, and Steel](https://wwnorton.com/books/9780393354324)_:

> Yet another type of explanation lists the immediate factors that enabled Europeans to kill or conquer other peoplesâ€”especially European guns, infectious diseases, steel tools, and manufactured products. Such an explanation is on the right track, as those factors demonstrably _were_ directly responsible for European conquests. However, this hypothesis is incomplete, because it still offers only a proximate (first-stage) explanation identifying immediate causes. It invites a search for ultimate causes: why were Europeans, rather than Africans or Native Americans, the ones to end up with guns, the nastiest germs, and steel?
