title: About
---

I'm an engineer and aspiring polymath. This website is my attempt to document my inner [latticework of theories](https://fs.blog/munger-worldly-wisdom/) that constitute the way I view the world -- mostly for [personal reference](https://blog.nindalf.com/posts/writing-helps-me-think/), but hopefully others will find it useful as well.

My background is in information security, and I currently work on [Trust and Safety](https://cyber.fsi.stanford.edu/io/content/sio-trust-and-safety-project). I'm also interested in history, philosophy, economics, sociology, and political science.

My email is dave(lastname)@gmail.com.
