Charlie Munger advocates a challenging process of [deeply understanding an idea before taking a stance on it](https://fs.blog/2013/04/the-work-required-to-have-an-opinion/). While I don't feel the 'requirement' aspect is realistic, I think this process is healthy and yields higher quality decisions, and I've tried to apply it to topics that are important to me. The following posts summarize my opinions on topics I feel I know well enough to write about:

<ul>
  {% for post in site.categories.opinions %}
    <li><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
  {% endfor %}
